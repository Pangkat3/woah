    <h2>Why should we help?</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>Aging is a natural part of our lives. Though it is something celebrated, it still has its downsides. Aging may cause reduced physical mobility, increased risk of sickness, and more that affect the brain and body. In cases where the family cannot support individuals in this stage of life, organizations like Good Samaritan step in to help them. Our program would like to help organizations like this as we believe in their mission.</p>
