    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>Help the elderly who are left behind or unable to be supported by their families, as many senior citizens face isolation and neglect. These individuals often require extra care, attention, and companionship, which their families may not be able to provide due to various reasons. Show support for organizations like Good Samaritan Nursing Home, which is dedicated to improving the lives of elderly individuals in need. Such organizations play a crucial role in offering specialized services, from medical care to emotional support. Meet the needs of the elderly under the care of home by ensuring they receive proper housing, nutrition, and healthcare. It's important to not only address their physical well-being but also their emotional needs, offering them dignity and respect. Visit and interact with the elderly and caretakers at the facility to better understand the challenges they face on a daily basis. Through these interactions, one can gain insight into how to further improve the quality of life for the elderly. Be aware of the issue of elder abandonment, which is a growing concern in many communities. Advocate for increased awareness and resources to prevent elder neglect and to ensure that all elderly individuals are treated with the care and compassion they deserve.</p>
