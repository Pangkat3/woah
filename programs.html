        <p>We would have a meet and greet with the elderly in the home care. We would interact with them, play a bit of games to entertain them, and we would give them donations.</p>

    <section>
        <p class="typeshii"> What is the impact? </p>
        <p>This could help the elderly mentally as we might never know, they might feel lonely in that home care and they could think that there aren't anybody that cares about them. <br>
            But this outreach activity could help them with that. This could also entertain them as they might be probably bored.</p>
